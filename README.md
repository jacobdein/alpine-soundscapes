# alpine-soundscapes
A collection of [jupyter](http://jupyter.org) notebooks for analyzing soundscapes â€” developed from my "Soundscapes of the Alpine Landscapes" project in Innsbruck, Austria supported by a Fulbright U.S. student grant.

## Mission

I am currently revising, improving, and adding new notebooks as I wrap up the project. All the data and results used in the analyses will be made easily accessible in the near future. I have tried to document my analysis process well and hope that this information will be useful to further soundscape research. I welcome suggestions and comments!

## Setup

### GRASS
Some of the notebooks use [GRASS GIS](https://grass.osgeo.org) (7.0.4), and must be run inside of a GRASS environment (start the jupyter notebook server from the GRASS command line).

Setup GRASS with a new location and mapset using an [EPSG](http://spatialreference.org) code:
```Shell
$ grass -c EPSG:31254 /home/ubuntu/grassdata/Innsbruck/PERMANENT
```

From the GRASS command line, disable the GUI:
```
GRASS:~ > g.gisenv set=GRASS_GUI=text
```

From the GRASS command line, start the jupyter notebook server:
```
GRASS:~ > jupyter notebook
```
